# docker-compose, where you can find everything you need
## The Idea
This repository contains a list of docker compose that I created in the years to help myself when I need to deploy applications for testing or as a permanent solution for some projects
## How to Navigate
You'll find a list of services in the direcotries, you just pick the service you need and you'll find different directories in it based on the different types of docker-compose, like testing, permanent, this and this ecc...
## You want to add your own docker-compose?
No problem, just open a PR and it will be evaluated, put the docker compose in the right directory and in case it is wrong i'll write it in a comment on the PR.
### Some hints to write a docker compose file:
1. Try to write it in the more flexible way, so it can be adapted for different use cases
2. Use env files to handle efficently customization
